# Documentation Plan for Chatlab

## Overview
To provide the best developer experience for Chatlab users, our goal is to create comprehensive, up-to-date, and easily accessible documentation. To achieve this, we will leverage a blend of automated and manual processes, targeting both module-level API reference docs and narrative guides for effective usage.

## Plan Outline
1. **API Reference Documentation Generation**: Implement a system that uses Python's `inspect` module to automate the generation of API reference documentation. The system will extract docstrings, methods, parameters, and default values from the `Chat` class and other relevant classes/functions in the `chatlab` module. The extracted data will be serialized into a JSON file.

2. **Integration into Docusaurus**: Leverage the power of Docusaurus's MDX feature to import the generated JSON file directly into the Markdown documentation files. The documentation for each method/function will be rendered dynamically based on the imported data.

3. **Existing Documentation Review**: Review the existing narrative documentation in the `website/docs` directory. Identify any deficiencies, outdated information, or areas for potential improvement.

4. **Manual Creation of Narrative Guides**: Develop narrative guides and tutorials that cover common use-cases, provide sample code, and explain more complex concepts in an easy-to-understand manner.

5. **Continued Updates and Maintenance**: Ensure the process in step 1 is triggered each time the documentation site is built. This ensures that API reference documentation stays up-to-date with any changes in the source code. Regularly review and update narrative guides based on user feedback and changes in package functionality.
