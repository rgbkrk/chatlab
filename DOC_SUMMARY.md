# Chatlab Documentation Summary

## Overview
Chatlab is a Python package that provides an interface for interactive chats inside computational notebooks, leveraging OpenAI's API. It enables users to conduct interactive conversations with AI models, register functions for the models to call, and perform various other operations.

## Documentation Structure
The documentation for Chatlab is divided into two main sections:

1. **API Reference**: Automatically generated documentation that provides detailed descriptions of the classes, functions, methods, and parameters in the Chatlab package. This serves as the go-to resource for technical details about the package. It is generated by a script that extracts docstrings and other information from the source code and formats them into a Docusaurus-friendly structure.

2. **Guides and Tutorials**: Manually written documentation that provides narrative explanations, guides, examples, and use-cases for the Chatlab package. These documents are meant to help users understand how to use the Chatlab package effectively, and they cover a variety of topics from basic usage to advanced features.

Both types of documentation are written in Markdown and are located in the `website/docs` directory.

## How to Use the Documentation
Users should start by reading the guides and tutorials to understand the basic features and capabilities of Chatlab. They should then refer to the API reference documentation for more detailed information about specific classes, functions, and methods.

All documentation should be viewed through the Docusaurus-powered website for the best reading experience, though the raw Markdown files can also be read directly for quick reference.

Developers maintaining or extending the Chatlab package should ensure they update the corresponding parts of both the guides/tutorials and the API reference documentation. To update the API reference documentation, they should update the appropriate docstrings in the source code and run the documentation generation script.
