> The following prioritization of the work needed could be considered:
>
> 1. `Chat` class and related methods
> 2. `Session` class and related methods
> 3. `Assistant` functions or methods
> 4. `User` and `System` related attributes or methods
> 5. `Narrate` related attributes or methods
> 6. Other attributes/methods: `Markdown`, `ai` etc.
> 7. Miscellaneous clean up and linking within docs
>    The accessible documents in a narrative form include:
>
> 8. _'Intro.md'_ - This is guide provides an overview on how to get started with Chatlab, how to set API keys, understanding the conversation roles, registering functions, submitting messages, and calling functions.
> 9. _'Setting-api-keys.md'_ - This guide provides detailed instructions on setting up API keys in various environments like Jupyter, Noteable, Colab, Kaggle, and other cloud notebooks.
> 10. _'Interpreter.mdx'_ - This documentation provides details on the builtin code interpreter in ChatLab. It also explains data personas and how the model can work with DataFrames.

```python
await chat("Session is deprecated. It's only exported to maintain backwards compatibility. Please document the `Chat` class instead. To see more of what's been written in a narrative form, see the other docs in `website/docs`.")
```

> Based on the documents above and the 'FunctionRegistry' document that we examined earlier, it seems like the undocumneted parts of the `Chatlab` package are its major classes like `Chat`, `ChatlabMetadata`, and `Conversation`, and some functions like `ai`, `assistant`, `narrate`, `system`, `user`.
>
> To generate a useful and comprehensive documentation, the priority should be:
>
> 1. Document the `Chat` class: As the core of the package and the focus of user interaction, this is a critical part to understand how to use the package. Details should include how to instantiate and manipulate a `Chat` object, special methods within the class, and other relevant details.
>
> 2. Document other important classes: `ChatlabMetadata` and `Conversation`. Detailed coverage of the functionalities provided by these classes will aid users in handling data and configuring the chat systems.
>
> 3. Document functions: Understanding helper functions like `ai`, `assistant`, `narrate`, `system`, `user` is crucial. Detailed coverage including code samples, use cases, and function details should be given.
>
> 4. Improve the existing documents: The existing documents typically lack some details. A good practice to follow while updating these documents would be to include information like links to relevant resources, caveats to watch out for, best practices, and how to resolve common errors.
>
> 5. Linking between Documents: Create cross-references between the documents so that users can easily navigate through the knowledge base.
>
> 6. Walkthroughs illustrating common workflows: This will provide practical, hands-on guidance to users.
>
> 7. Miscellaneous clean up and checks: This includes tasks that enhance overall readability and ease of use like fixing broken links, updating document metadata, improving content organization, and, ensuring a consistent style across all documents.
