Welcome to the exciting world of programmatic chat with OpenAI's chat models, using the `murkrow` Python package. At its simplest, you can install `murkrow`, set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and begin some simple chats:

```python
import murkrow

conversation = murkrow.Conversation()

conversation.submit("How much wood could a")
```

```markdown
woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
```

In the notebook, text will stream into a Markdown output.

When using chat functions in the notebook\*, you'll get a nice collapsible display of inputs and outputs.

\* Tested in JupyterLab and Noteable

### Installation

```bash
pip install murkrow
```

### Configuration

You'll need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can find your API key on your [OpenAI account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). I recommend setting it in an `.env` file when working locally.

On hosted environments like Noteable, set it in your Secrets to keep it safe from prying LLM eyes.

## What can `Conversation`s enable _you_ to do?

Where `Conversation`s take it next level is with _Chat Functions_. You can

-   declare a function with a schema
-   register the function in your `Conversation`
-   watch as Chat Models call your functions!

You may recall this kind of behavior from [ChatGPT Plugins](https://noteable.io/chatgpt-plugin-for-notebook/). Now, you can take this even further with your own custom code.

As an example, let's give the large language models the ability to tell time.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from pytz import timezone, all_timezones, utc
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

def what_time(tz: Optional[str] = None):
    '''Current time, defaulting to UTC'''
    if tz is None:
        pass
    elif tz in all_timezones:
        tz = timezone(tz)
    else:
        return 'Invalid timezone'

    return datetime.now(tz).strftime('%I:%M %p')

class WhatTime(BaseModel):
    tz: Optional[str] = None
```

Let's break this down.

`what_time` is the function we're going to provide access to. Its docstring forms the `description` for the model while the schema comes from the pydantic `BaseModel` called `WhatTime`.

```python
import murkrow

conversation = murkrow.Conversation()

# Register our function
conversation.register(what_time, WhatTime)

# Pluck the chat function off for easy access
chat = conversation.chat
```

After that, we can call `chat` with direct strings (which are turned into user messages) or using simple message makers from `murkrow` named `human`/`user` and `narrate`/`system`.

```python
chat("What time is it?")
```

```markdown
▶ 𝑓 Ran `what_time`

The current time is 11:47 PM.
```

## Interface

The `murkrow` package exports

### `Conversation`

The `Conversation` class is the main way to chat using OpenAI's models. It keeps a history of your chat in `Conversation.messages`.

#### `Conversation.chat`

When you call `chat`, you're sending over messages to the chat model and getting back an updating `Markdown` display live.

```python
conversation.submit("What would a parent who says "I have to play zone defense" mean? ")
# Markdown response inline
conversation.messages
```

```js
[{'role': 'user',
  'content': 'What does a parent of three kids mean by "I have to play zone defense"?'},
 {'role': 'assistant',
  'content': 'When a parent of three kids says "I have to play zone defense," it means that they...
```

#### `Conversation.register`

You can register functions with `Conversation.register` to make them available to the chat model. The function's docstring becomes the description of the function while the schema is derived from the `pydantic.BaseModel` passed in.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class WhatTime(BaseModel):
    tz: Optional[str] = None

def what_time(tz: Optional[str] = None):
    '''Current time, defaulting to UTC'''
    if tz is None:
        pass
    elif tz in all_timezones:
        tz = timezone(tz)
    else:
        return 'Invalid timezone'

    return datetime.now(tz).strftime('%I:%M %p')

conversation.register(what_time, WhatTime)
```

#### `Conversation.messages`

The raw messages sent and received to OpenAI. If you hit a token limit, you can remove old messages from the list to make room for more.

```python
conversation.messages = conversation.messages[-100:]
```

### Messaging

#### `human`/`user`

These functions create a message from the user to the chat model.

```python
from murkrow import human

human("How are you?")
```

```json
{ "role": "user", "content": "How are you?" }
```

#### `narrate`/`system`

`system` messages, also called `narrate` in `murkrow`, allow you to steer the model in a direction. You can use these to provide context without being seen by the user. One common use is to include it as initial context for the conversation.

```python
from murkrow import narrate

narrate("You are a large bird")
```

```json
{ "role": "system", "content": "You are a large bird" }
```

## Development

This project uses poetry for dependency management. To get started, clone the repo and run

```bash
poetry install -E dev -E test
```

We use `black`, `isort`, and `mypy`.
